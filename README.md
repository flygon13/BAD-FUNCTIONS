# zpack
collection of simple functions that I use commonly

very small homemade functions to cut down on typing time and line usage

nothing fancy all the functions are extremely basic and can be improved upon

no idea how github works and hopes this allows me to use my functions on school computers


#-FUNCTIONS
usable = All characters from strings but whitespace. For passwords and crap

ln = Prints an empty line. Supposed to cut down typing time for text based programs

abscheck = Returns true if int/float is negative returns false if positive

shuffle = shuffles a list using random. x is the number of times the function takes an item and moves it

move = moves the index x to index y in table

isint = compares x to 1 and returns true if x is an int

removedups = remove duplicate items in a list

reverse = reverse a string

clear = clear the console

osuser = easy access to the currently logged on user so you won't need to make a variable and can user it in paths

there's no setup file to move it to your Lib folder or anything so you gotta do that yourself sorry

thanks for looking
